## Tutorial Writing Checklist

When writing or reviewing blog posts that are tutorials (step-by-step
guides, how-tos), check against these rules. Source:

  Rule                                          Check
  ----                                          -----
  1. Write for beginners                        No unexplained jargon; a
                                                newcomer can follow along
  2. Promise a clear outcome in the title       Title says what the reader
                                                will build or achieve
  3. Explain the goal in the introduction       Opening answers "why should
                                                I care?" and "is this for me?"
  4. Show the end result                        Demo, screenshot, or output
                                                shown early
  5. Make code snippets copy/pasteable          No shell prompts ($) in
                                                copyable blocks; use
                                                non-interactive flags; chain
                                                with &&
  6. Use long command-line flags                --recursive not -r
  7. Separate user-defined values               Use variables or constants
                                                for values the reader must
                                                change; comment what to
                                                customize
  8. Use unambiguous example values             Example data is obviously
                                                example data, not confusable
                                                with syntax
  9. Spare the reader from mindless tasks       Automate tedious steps with
                                                commands instead of manual
                                                instructions
  10. Keep code in a working state              Each intermediate step
                                                compiles/runs; use stubs if
                                                needed
  11. Teach one thing                           One concept per tutorial;
                                                defer secondary topics
  12. Don't try to look pretty                  Minimal styling; clarity
                                                over aesthetics
  13. Minimize dependencies                     Avoid unnecessary libraries;
                                                pin versions when used
  14. Specify filenames clearly                 Full file paths; indicate
                                                where in the file to add code
  15. Use consistent, descriptive headings      Clear hierarchy; consistent
                                                casing and verb tense
  16. Demonstrate that the solution works       Show verification output or
                                                screenshot proving success
  17. Link to a complete example                Provide a repo or gist with
                                                the full working code
