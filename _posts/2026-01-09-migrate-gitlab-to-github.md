I've migrated from gitlab to github in 2021 which had some issues: [https://github.com/piceaTech/node-gitlab-2-github/issues/99](https://github.com/piceaTech/node-gitlab-2-github/issues/99)

Most important was maintaining the history, so that included:

- user mapping
- commit mapping
- project mapping
- attachments
- issue information
- descriptions, labels, milestones, merge requests

Tool used: [https://github.com/piceaTech/node-gitlab-2-github](https://github.com/piceaTech/node-gitlab-2-github)

Have fun.
