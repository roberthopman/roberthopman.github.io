WEM is a no-code application development platform. Asked to work on widgets for a client, I entered the ecosystem. 

Conditionals in WEMscript that I wrote (with CSS):

`<? if (@A > @B) then ?>transform: rotateY(180deg);<? end ?>`

Using MacOS with a Chrome browser, the most annoying thing I encountered was not being able to confidently cut/copy/paste (these) code snippets inside the WEM V3 widget editor. Which meant all characters had to be typed in manually! Tip: use another browser.
